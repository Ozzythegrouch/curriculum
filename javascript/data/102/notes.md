##Three Simple data types

### string
A string is defined with `'` or`"`
```
let location = 'Atlanta, Georgia'
to include quote in string use double quotes on outside
```

###boolean
The value of a boolean is either `true` or `false`.
```
const isNew= false;
either true or false
not in quotes
```

###number
Pretty straightforward but `number` cannot write really, really big numbers.
```
let age = 32;
not in quotes
```
