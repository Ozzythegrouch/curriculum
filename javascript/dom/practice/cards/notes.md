# DOM Cards

## Stackblitz exercise

Event delegation - when an element is clicked but no event listener attached to specific element added to it goes to parent. If that parent doesn't have one it goes all the way up until it finds one.

`e.target` is element itself

attribute added to distinguish from parent

attribute to div does not need to be added with equal sign. If not key value pair it resolves as true. 

attribute to div only needs equal sign if we care about specific value

`.getAttribute` gets actual attribute

`.hasAttribute` if string exists in html then use in javascript 

`data` is a custom attribute
