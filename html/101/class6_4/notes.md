### Links to style sheets
```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />
```

Block level element - takes up full width of box
inline-block -takes up the space around the word

Floats- remove all attributes for item

Lorem Ipsum - words to put on your site as a placeholder

`,` means same style rules are being applied to both

pseudo element - doesn't really exist; no naming convention, still treated like an actual element

postition static

position fixed- item fixed to the viiewport

position absolute - no width or height

html 5 gives boilerplate layout to start html file

natural flow of the elements - left to right

if float with no content, attributes disappear
